##  Introduction

This repo contains source code for **DiffusionAD** implemented with PyTorch.

DiffusionAD is a novel framework for anomaly detection and localization, which consists of a reconstruction sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. The reconstruction sub-network is implemented via a diffusion model and is tasked with recovering anomalous images to anomaly-free ones. The segmentation sub-network predicts pixel-level anomaly scores using the input image and its anomaly-free recovery. Remarkably, we adopt a one-step denoising paradigm, which is considerably faster than iterative denoising approaches. Furthermore, the proposed norm-guided paradigm enhances the fidelity of the anomaly-free reconstruction.​

## Get Started 

### Environment 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data

#### MvTec-AD
Download the dataset from [here](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/).

#### VisA
Download the dataset from [here](https://amazon-visual-anomaly.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/VisA_20220922.tar).

#### Foreground
In the anomaly synthetic strategy, we employ different foreground extraction methods for datasets belonging to different classes. For the object dataset, we use [DIS](https://github.com/xuebinqin/DIS) to extract foregrounds. For the textural dataset, we design the foreground as a random part of the entire image.​ ​​The Describable Textures dataset is one of the anomaly source image sets and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/).

Images of these foregrounds can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1goH-PqWD35jvXuZNcBlR6elKf7eBx8lY?usp=drive_link).

Finally, make sure that these datasets follow the data tree.
